# Do you even lift?
Ever go to the gym and think, "Man, I really wish I remembered what I could lift 2 weeks ago?" I know I have! That's why I created an app to track all of my fitness (and now you can too!) Here are steps we take to track your workouts:
### Step One: Log it!

As you can see in the screenshot, you start on the Fitness Tracker page. This will show the last workout logged. You have the choice to continue with your previous log or create a new one. 
### Step Two: Creating a new workout

When we create a new workout we are taken to the page above. Here you can select type of excersize and add the information in as shown. Once we are done, click Add Exercise, then complete. This will take you back to step one, where you can either add more or click "dashboard"
### Step Three: Tracking your fitness on the Dashboard

Third and most importantly, is where you will track the progress you have made. This will be displayed on the dashboard, where you can track your progress and overall feel great about it!
